# Project Overview: Vertical and Horizontal Escalation

This project documents a decade of sexual violence, institutional betrayal, and public funds fraud across Korea's leading film schools and their industry partners. What began as an investigation into Dongguk University's failures has escalated both **horizontally** (expanding to reveal systemic risks at K-Arts, Chung-Ang, Hongik, Seoul Institute of the Arts, Korea National University of Arts, Myongji College, Cheongju University, Kyungsung University, University of Seoul, and more) and **vertically**—from university-level exposure to the industry partners in the Korean film and TV sector, especially those with ties to global platforms like Netflix, which has invested $2.5 billion USD in Korean content over four years.

The timeline now bridges academia and industry, exposing how these universities serve as talent pipelines for Netflix and other major content partners—raising urgent questions about industry complicity and the need for robust sexual violence prevention and reporting policies across all Korean content production.

## Purpose: Exposing Structural Vulnerabilities and Systemic Risks

### Why This Project Exists

- **Vertical Escalation:** Our investigation has moved beyond exposing failures within individual universities to holding their industry partners—especially Netflix and other global content platforms—accountable for the systemic risks that originate in Korean film schools. Netflix and its Korean production partners face direct Title IX and ESG compliance risks due to their association with institutions that have documented patterns of sexual violence, cover-ups, and institutional betrayal. We are calling on Netflix to conduct comprehensive audits of all Korean content partners for university affiliations, and to require robust, transparent sexual violence reporting and prevention mechanisms as a condition of partnership. These obligations are not only ethical, but are likely already embedded in standard partner agreements (morals clauses, reputational risk provisions, ESG commitments) and are essential for protecting Netflix's brand, investors, and audiences.

- **Horizontal Escalation:** Outreach to other major film schools (see `source_materials/emails/05122025-other-unis-first.md`) reveals similar vulnerabilities: extreme gender imbalance among faculty, workshop-based curricula with high-risk environments (after-hours shoots, one-on-one mentoring, hierarchical power dynamics, industry networking), and a lack of transparent reporting or support mechanisms for students. Many programs have only one or zero tenured female professors, and few have active women's councils or independent oversight.

- **Industry Bridge:** These universities are key talent pipelines for Netflix and other global content producers. Without robust sexual violence prevention and accountability policies, industry partners risk perpetuating and benefiting from institutional failures—creating Title IX compliance risks and reputational dangers for international collaborators.

### Structural Vulnerabilities (from Dongguk and Other Universities)

- No visible, independent reporting system for sexual violence and sexual assault
- Extreme gender imbalance among faculty (often only one or zero tenured female professors)
- Abolition or absence of Women's Student Councils or equivalent support bodies
- Workshop-based, industry-facing curricula that create high-risk, low-supervision environments
- Documented patterns of institutional negligence, delayed responses, and prioritization of reputation over student safety
- Lack of transparent data on sexual violence reports and outcomes
- Inadequate training for faculty and industry professionals on professional boundaries and student protection

These vulnerabilities are detailed in our outreach to universities and in the timeline of events. They are not unique to Dongguk, but are found across Korea's film education sector and now implicate the entire content production pipeline.

## KWDI Research: The Data Behind the Crisis

Research from the Korean Women's Development Institute (KWDI) confirms the scale and urgency of the problem:

- **61.5%** of female arts students in Korea report experiencing sexual violence
- **65.5%** of campus sexual violence cases are perpetrated by professors
- Film programs are the highest-risk environment (risk score: 81/100)

These findings are echoed in our own documentation and in the responses (or lack thereof) from universities and government agencies.

## Confirmed Cases of Institutional Misrepresentation

Despite these red flags, Dongguk and other universities continue to publicly list a wide range of U.S., Canadian, and European universities as partners on their official websites, even when those partnerships are disputed or under review. This raises concerns about false advertising and the misuse of public funds.

## Timeline of Events

- **2018:** Female Student Council Abolished during the height of the MeToo movement
- **2020:** KWDI Report published on sexual violence in arts education after MeToo
- **March 8-9, 2025:** Initial email outreach to Dongguk University, no response
- **March 14-15, 2025:** All faculty members contacted, no responses
