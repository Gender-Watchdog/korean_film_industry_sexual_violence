      <h3 class="h5 mb-2"><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</strong></h3>
      <p>Our advocacy efforts have uncovered critical systemic failures in South Korea's higher education system that pose serious risks to international students. The Korean government's International Education Quality Assurance System (IEQAS) – the official certification meant to guarantee safety and quality for international students – appears to be fundamentally compromised.</p>
      <p>Through investigating Dongguk University, we've discovered a disturbing pattern where an IEQAS-certified institution can simultaneously:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Maintain a film program with documented sexual violence risks</li>
        <li>Falsify international partnerships</li>
        <li>Misrepresent credentials to secure government funding</li>
      </ul>
      <p>More troubling, the Korean Ministry of Education and six other government agencies have maintained complete silence since April 10, 2025 (32 days as of this writing on May 12, 2025) after receiving concrete evidence of these violations, suggesting a systemic failure of oversight that could extend across Korea's higher education landscape.</p>
      <p>This exposé details how these findings threaten the credibility of Korea's ambitious goal to recruit 300,000 international students by 2027 and calls into question the safety of current and prospective international students at Korean universities.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Human Cost of Systemic Failures</h3>
    <p>Through our advocacy work, we have documented multiple cases of international students suffering serious adverse health impacts as direct consequences of sexual violence at Korean universities. These include severe psychological trauma, social isolation, academic disruption, and physical health deterioration. International students are particularly vulnerable due to language barriers, cultural differences, and limited support networks. The silencing of these experiences further compounds the trauma, as victims have nowhere to turn for institutional support or justice. These are not abstract concerns but real, ongoing suffering that demands immediate attention.</p>

    <h2>THE COMPROMISED IEQAS CERTIFICATION</h2>
    <p>The International Education Quality Assurance System (IEQAS) is the Korean government's official accreditation program for universities serving international students. According to the Ministry of Education's own documentation:</p>

    <blockquote class="blockquote">
      <p>"IEQAS is a comprehensive quality assurance system designed to evaluate and certify Korean universities' international education programs... to ensure they meet international standards for quality and safety."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>IEQAS certification is presented to foreign governments, international universities, prospective students, and parents as an authoritative guarantee that a Korean university is safe and ethical for international students.</p>

    <p>However, our investigation into Dongguk University – which maintains IEQAS certification – reveals this system may be fundamentally compromised.</p>

    <h3>Critical Timing: Recent Certification Despite Ongoing Issues</h3>
    <p>In a stark illustration of the system's failure, Dongguk University proudly announced on January 20, 2025, that it had been granted IEQAS certification for the 2024 cycle. According to their official announcement, this certification is valid from March 2025 to February 2026. This means that less than four months after receiving this prestigious certification – which supposedly validates their international student protections – our exposé revealed serious structural safety failures and partnership misrepresentations at the institution.</p>

    <p>The timing reveals a troubling disconnect: the same institution that was deemed worthy of IEQAS certification in January 2025 was demonstrably falsifying international partnerships and failing to address sexual violence risks by May 2025. This raises fundamental questions about the rigor and effectiveness of the entire certification process.</p>

      </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>Three Critical Failures of the IEQAS System</h3>

    <h4>1. Certification Despite Sexual Violence Risks</h4>
    <p>Dongguk University maintains IEQAS certification despite:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Housing a film program with the highest risk score (81/100) for sexual violence according to the Korean Women's Development Institute</li>
      <li>Maintaining an all-male faculty in its Graduate School of Digital Image and Contents</li>
      <li>Disbanding its Women's Student Council in 2018</li>
      <li>Documented negligence in handling sexual assault cases, including a 2016 incident where the university took no action for six months after being notified by prosecutors</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The Korean Women's Development Institute (KWDI) research shows 61.5% of female arts students experience sexual violence, with 65.5% of campus sexual violence perpetrated by professors. Yet Dongguk's IEQAS certification remains intact.</p>

      </ul>
    </div>

    <h4>2. Certification Despite Falsified International Partnerships</h4>
    <p>Dongguk University claimed 381 international university partnerships as recently as May 12, 2025, on its official website. However:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A Canadian university has officially confirmed they "do not have a student exchange agreement with Dongguk University" despite being listed as a partner</li>
      <li>Multiple U.S. universities have acknowledged they are re-evaluating their partnerships with Dongguk</li>
      <li>A prominent global university ranking organization has escalated these concerns to their management</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Korean universities receive government funding partly based on their international partnerships, raising serious questions about potential financial fraud. Yet the Ministry of Education has failed to investigate or reconsider Dongguk's IEQAS status.</p>

      </ul>
    </div>

    <h4>3. Systematic Government Inaction</h4>
    <p>On April 10, 2025, we submitted conclusive evidence of falsified partnerships to seven Korean government oversight bodies, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ministry of Education</li>
      <li>National Research Foundation</li>
      <li>Korean Council for University Education</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Since that date – now over a month ago – all seven agencies have maintained complete silence despite direct follow-up requests. This extended period of government inaction constitutes a critical failure of oversight that endangers students and compromises the integrity of the entire certification system.</p>

    <h5>Expanding Investigation Scope Due to Government and University Unresponsiveness</h5>
    <p>Due to the complete unresponsiveness of Korean government agencies and Dongguk University for over 34 days, we are now expanding the scope of our investigation to examine:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Partnership claims of additional Korean universities</li>
      <li>Faculty gender ratios across departments at multiple institutions</li>
      <li>Other structural factors that could render Korean universities "too risky" under Title IX laws for U.S. universities to maintain as partner institutions</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This expanded investigation has already revealed concerning patterns across multiple institutions and raises serious questions about the viability of U.S.-Korea academic partnerships under Title IX compliance requirements.</p>

    <h2>WHY THIS IS A SYSTEMIC ISSUE, NOT AN ISOLATED CASE</h2>
    <h3>IEQAS Certification Appears Compromised</h3>
    <p>If Dongguk can maintain IEQAS certification despite:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Documented sexual violence risks</li>
      <li>Falsified international partnerships</li>
      <li>Misrepresentation for financial gain</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Then the certification itself cannot be trusted. This means either:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The certification process is negligently lax, or</li>
      <li>It's intentionally compromised to prioritize recruitment targets over student safety</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Either scenario implicates the entire Korean higher education governance system.</p>

    <h3>The 300,000 International Student Target Creates Perverse Incentives</h3>
    <p>The Korean government's ambitious goal to recruit 300,000 international students by 2027 creates systemic pressure to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Present Korean universities in the best possible light</li>
      <li>Reduce oversight of safety issues</li>
      <li>Maintain IEQAS certifications regardless of compliance</li>
      <li>Prioritize international reputation over accountability</li>
    </ul>

    <p>What began as an investigation into one university has revealed a disturbing pattern where government funding mechanisms based on international partnerships may be creating perverse incentives across multiple institutions.</p>

    <h4>Enrollment Numbers Over Student Safety?</h4>
    <p>The Korean Ministry of Education's official announcement of the "Study Korea 300K Project" reveals a troubling emphasis on quantity over quality. The press release explicitly states the goal is for "Korea to be the top 10 world-leading countries for study abroad by 2027" with "anticipated benefits" focused primarily on "stimulating regional economy" and "enhancing global competitiveness." Notably absent from these stated priorities is any meaningful discussion of student safety, particularly for vulnerable international students.</p>

    <p>This raises critical questions: Is the Korean government willing to compromise safety standards and oversight to achieve their ambitious enrollment targets? Are they prioritizing raw enrollment numbers over the actual well-being of international students they're aggressively recruiting? The case of Dongguk University suggests a system where certification remains intact despite clear evidence of structural failures, indicating that the answer to these questions may be deeply troubling.</p>

    <h4>Korean Education Experts Sound the Alarm</h4>
    <p>Even Korean education experts have publicly criticized the government's approach. In a November 2023 Times Higher Education report, Jun Hyun Hong, a professor at Chung-Ang University who served as an adviser to the government on the 300K initiative, warned that the approach was "unsustainable," stating:</p>

    <blockquote class="blockquote">
      <p>"The government is only focusing on [a] number – I always say that education now is considered part of industry, but this is an industrial view, this is not an education view."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Professor Hong specifically cautioned that "without proper structures to ensure quality of education for overseas students, a push to significantly increase their numbers could ultimately backfire." He revealed that despite his warnings, "the government is not that interested in that yet."</p>

    <p>Other experts in the article echoed these concerns:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Minah Park from the Korean Council for University Education acknowledged they needed "more time" to properly serve international students</li>
      <li>Chong-yang Kim, president emeritus at Hanyang University, criticized the lack of a concrete strategy to support institutions</li>
      <li>Multiple experts highlighted inadequate support structures for international students</li>
    </ul>

    <p>With less than two years remaining until the 2027 deadline and an estimated gap of 120,000 students to reach the target (as of late 2023), our evidence suggests the government may now be in "panic mode" - willing to overlook serious safety issues, partnership misrepresentations, and quality concerns in a desperate push to achieve their numeric goal.</p>

    </div>

    <h3>Interconnected Failures of Financial Oversight and Sexual Violence Prevention</h3>
    <p>Our advocacy has revealed a pattern of "dual neglect" where:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Financial oversight failures (like ignoring falsified partnerships) and</li>
      <li>Sexual violence prevention failures (like ignoring KWDI's risk assessment)</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Both stem from the same root causes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Weak oversight mechanisms</li>
      <li>Lack of transparency</li>
      <li>Power imbalances</li>
      <li>Culture of silence</li>
      <li>Prioritization of institutional reputation over accountability</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Government inaction on the more easily provable financial allegations directly reinforces conditions that enable sexual violence to flourish.</p>

    <h2>INTERNATIONAL IMPLICATIONS AND CASCADING CONSEQUENCES</h2>
    <h3>Foreign Universities' Trust in IEQAS Is Now Compromised</h3>
    <p>Foreign universities can no longer trust a Korean university's IEQAS status as a guarantee of safety or ethics. This casts doubt on every IEQAS-accredited university and undermines the Korean government's entire international education strategy.</p>

    <h3>The International Cascade Effect Has Begun</h3>
    <p>We're already witnessing the beginning of what could become a devastating cascade effect:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Multiple U.S. universities are reviewing their partnerships, citing Title IX compliance concerns</li>
      <li>A Canadian university has already publicly denied partnership with Dongguk</li>
      <li>A global university ranking organization has escalated these concerns to senior management</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="alert alert-light border my-4">
      <h4 class="h6 mb-2"><strong>Source Documentation:</strong></h4>
      <ul class="mb-0">
        <li>University responses to our outreach: <a href="https://drive.proton.me/urls/95J0T3K37R#RBCO657BAC6a" target="_blank">University Responses</a></li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>Title IX Compliance Risk for U.S. Partner Institutions</h3>
    <p>U.S. universities face significant legal liability if their foreign partner institutions fail to maintain Title IX compliance standards regarding sexual violence prevention and response. As awareness of Dongguk's structural sexual violence risks spreads, U.S. institutions will likely be forced to terminate partnerships to avoid legal exposure.</p>

    <h3>Economic Threat to Korea's Educational and Cultural Exports</h3>
    <p>For a country investing heavily in becoming an educational hub and cultural exporter, the economic impact could be devastating:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Dongguk's film school directly feeds talent into Korea's entertainment industry</li>
      <li>Netflix is investing $2.5 billion in Korean content over four years</li>
      <li>The Korean Wave (Hallyu) depends on maintaining international trust and ethical standards</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Government failure to address these issues threatens not just education but Korea's broader cultural export strategy.</p>
