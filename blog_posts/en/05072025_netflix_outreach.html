      <h3 class="h5 mb-2"><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</strong></h3>
      <p>On May 6-7, 2025, the Gender Watchdog Research Collective sent urgent notifications to Netflix and Netflix Korea, alerting them to significant Title IX compliance risks and reputational dangers stemming from systemic sexual violence across Korean universities with arts programs. These institutions are key talent pipelines for Netflix's Korean content partners.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Recipients:</strong> korea@netflix.com, privacy@netflix.com, pr@netflix.com, info@account.netflix.com, and key Title IX and advocacy organizations (see full list in original emails).</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h3>Key Findings Communicated</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Widespread Sexual Violence:</strong> The Korean Women's Development Institute (KWDI) reports that 61.5% of female arts students experience sexual violence, with film departments being the highest risk (81/100 risk score). The problem is not isolated to Dongguk University but is systemic across all major Korean arts programs.</li>
      <li><strong>Direct Risk to Netflix:</strong> Netflix's $2.5 billion investment in Korean content is at risk due to indirect association with institutions covering up sexual violence. Any Korean content partner with university affiliations represents a potential Title IX compliance risk.</li>
      <li><strong>Contractual and ESG Implications:</strong> Standard partner agreements and ESG commitments may be compromised by these revelations, potentially triggering morals clauses and reputational risk provisions.</li>
      <li><strong>Public Funds Fraud:</strong> Allegations of public funds misuse at Dongguk University are directly linked to the culture of sexual violence cover-ups.</li>
      <li><strong>Documented Institutional Failures:</strong> The emails detail the absence of transparent sexual violence reporting, dismantling of women's councils, and patterns of institutional inaction.</li>
      <li><strong>Broader Industry Impact:</strong> The issue extends to all Korean arts universities and their industry partners, with multiple high-profile cases and international partners reviewing or severing ties.</li>
    </ul>
